			<h2>Alternatives to Eating Out in Phuket</h2>

<p>It is nice to dine out on holiday, but those who play to say on Phuket for longer periods of time can become bored with restaurants. Sometimes it is just nice to be able to eat in your villa or apartment. This can also be a good way to save money. There are a number of good options for people looking for fast food deliveries in Phuket including:</p>


<br><p><ins>KFC</ins></p><br>

<br><p><ins>Subway</ins></p><br>
